## The Division Algebra Foundation

### Hurwitz Theorem (1898)

```
THEOREM: There are exactly FOUR normed division algebras:

    1. Real numbers R       (dimension 1)
    2. Complex numbers C    (dimension 2)
    3. Quaternions H        (dimension 4)
    4. Octonions O          (dimension 8)

NO OTHERS EXIST. This is a mathematical theorem, not a choice.

Properties:
    R: Commutative, associative
    C: Commutative, associative
    H: NON-commutative, associative
    O: NON-commutative, NON-associative
```

### Gauge Groups from Division Algebras

```
Each division algebra gives a gauge structure:

    R -> trivial (no gauge symmetry)
    C -> U(1)    (electromagnetic)
    H -> SU(2)   (weak nuclear)
    O -> SU(3)   (strong nuclear, via G_2)

The mapping:
    Division algebra norm preservation -> Gauge invariance
    Algebra automorphisms -> Gauge transformations
    Non-commutativity -> Non-Abelian gauge theory
```

---

## Derivation of Each Gauge Group

### U(1) - Electromagnetic (Phase 113)

```
ORIGIN: Complex phase redundancy

Physical states depend on |psi|^2, not psi.
This gives global U(1): psi -> e^{i*theta} * psi

Promote to local: psi(x) -> e^{i*theta(x)} * psi(x)
Requires gauge field A_mu for consistency.

RESULT: Electromagnetism = U(1) gauge theory
        Photon = gauge boson of U(1)

COORDINATION MEANING:
    - Global phase = overall I vs Pi calibration
    - Local phase = point-by-point calibration freedom
    - A_mu = connection between local calibrations
```

### SU(2) - Weak Nuclear Force

```
ORIGIN: Spinor structure from SWAP symmetry

Phase 112: SWAP S: (I, Pi) -> (Pi, I) has covering group SU(2)
Dirac spinor has left-handed and right-handed parts.

KEY INSIGHT: Weak force couples ONLY to left-handed!

This follows from coordination:
    - SWAP has two orientations (left/right)
    - Left-handed = one orientation of I-Pi exchange
    - Right-handed = opposite orientation
    - Weak force = gauge field of LEFT-HANDED SWAP only

RESULT: Weak force = SU(2)_L gauge theory
        W+, W-, Z = gauge bosons of SU(2) x U(1)

WHY NON-ABELIAN?
    Quaternions are non-commutative: i*j != j*i
    Therefore [T_a, T_b] != 0
    W bosons interact with each other!
```

### SU(3) - Strong Nuclear Force (QCD)

```
ORIGIN: Octonion automorphisms via G_2 -> SU(3)

Step 1: Aut(O) = G_2 (exceptional Lie group, dim 14)
Step 2: Fix direction e_7 in Im(O)
Step 3: Stabilizer of e_7 is SU(3)
Step 4: Remaining 6 units form C^3 = color space

RESULT: Strong force = SU(3)_color gauge theory
        8 gluons = gauge bosons of SU(3)

COLOR CHARGE:
    |r> = (1, 0, 0)  (red)
    |g> = (0, 1, 0)  (green)
    |b> = (0, 0, 1)  (blue)

WHY CONFINEMENT?
    Octonions are non-associative: (a*b)*c != a*(b*c)
    "Isolated color" has no consistent definition!
    Only colorless combinations are physical.

    CONFINEMENT IS ALGEBRAIC, NOT DYNAMICAL!
```

## The Standard Model Gauge Group

### Complete Structure

```
G_SM = SU(3)_color x SU(2)_weak x U(1)_hypercharge

Generators:
    SU(3): 8 (Gell-Mann matrices) -> 8 gluons
    SU(2): 3 (Pauli matrices / 2) -> W+, W-, W^0
    U(1):  1                       -> B^0
    Total: 12 gauge bosons before symmetry breaking

After electroweak symmetry breaking:
    SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y -> U(1)_EM

Physical bosons:
    8 gluons (massless, confined)
    W+ (massive)
    W- (massive)
    Z^0 (massive)
    Photon (massless)
```

### Why This Specific Group?

```
The Standard Model gauge group is UNIQUELY determined:

1. DIVISION ALGEBRA CONSTRAINT
   Only R, C, H, O exist (Hurwitz)
   These give trivial, U(1), SU(2), contains SU(3)
   No other options!

2. LORENTZ INVARIANCE
   Spinors required for fermions
   Spinor structure comes from H
   Therefore SU(2) is necessary

3. CHIRAL STRUCTURE
   Left and right spinors are different
   Weak couples only to left-handed
   This gives SU(2)_L specifically

4. ANOMALY CANCELLATION
   Quantum consistency requires specific charges
   This fixes hypercharge assignments uniquely
   Requires quarks + leptons together!

THE STANDARD MODEL IS NOT A CHOICE - IT'S FORCED BY MATHEMATICS!
```

## Electroweak Unification

```
At high energies: G_EW = SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y

COORDINATION ORIGIN:
    - SU(2)_L: Left-handed SWAP symmetry
    - U(1)_Y: Hypercharge (complex phase)
    - Must combine: C is subset of H (quaternions contain complexes)

Electroweak symmetry breaking:
    SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y -> U(1)_EM

Physical bosons after breaking:
    W+ = (W^1 - i*W^2) / sqrt(2)   [massive, charged]
    W- = (W^1 + i*W^2) / sqrt(2)   [massive, charged]
    Z  = cos(theta_W)*W^3 - sin(theta_W)*B   [massive, neutral]
    A  = sin(theta_W)*W^3 + cos(theta_W)*B   [photon, massless]

Weinberg angle: sin^2(theta_W) ~ 0.23
(Derivation from coordination is open question Q503)
```

## Connections to Earlier Phases

### Phase 112: Dirac Equation
```
Phase 112 derived spinor structure from SWAP symmetry.
Phase 114 shows this SAME structure gives SU(2) weak force!
SWAP -> Z_2 -> SU(2) -> weak interaction.
```

### Phase 113: QED
```
Phase 113 derived U(1) from coordination redundancy.
Phase 114 shows this fits into larger SU(2) x U(1) structure.
Electroweak unification is NATURAL in this framework.
```

### Phase 25-27: Octonions and Division Algebras
```
Phases 25-27 identified octonions and E_8 structure.
Phase 114 shows SU(3) emerges from octonion automorphisms!
The division algebra prediction is VALIDATED.
```

### Phase 107: Coordination Hamiltonian
```
Phase 107 established H(I, Pi) = kT*ln(2)*I + (hbar*c/2d)*Pi.
Gauge symmetries are redundancies in describing this dynamics.
Different algebras = different types of redundancy.
```
