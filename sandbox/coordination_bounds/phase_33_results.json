Q_j cannot equal its own complement.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS (probabilistic):\nIf Q_j outputs 1 with probability p:\n  - Q_j says QDIAG_f(j) = 1 with probability p\n  - But QDIAG_f(j) = 1 - Q_j(j), so correct answer is 0 with probability p\n  - Q_j is WRONG with probability p when it outputs 1\n\nSimilarly Q_j is wrong with probability (1-p) when it outputs 0.\n\nTotal error = p*p + (1-p)*(1-p) = p^2 + (1-p)^2 >= 1/2\n\nError is ALWAYS >= 1/2, never < 1/3.\n\nTherefore Q_j CANNOT solve QDIAG_f with bounded error.
