    "P1: Efficiency peaks at crossover",

  "mathematical_insight": "The factor of 2 emerges from the structure of complementary resource constraints. Any optimization problem with two complementary costs (one fixed, one inversely proportional to the optimization variable) will show a factor of 2 at the optimal crossover point.",
