# Rhizo Brand Guide

## Name

**Product:** Rhizo
**Company/Domain:** Rhizodata
**Tagline:** Data, connected.

---

## The Pitch

> "Traditional data systems are trees - hierarchical, siloed, one path to your data. Rhizo is a rhizome - every table connects to every other, every version is reachable, every branch is instant. No center. No bottleneck. Just data, connected."

---

## The Story

The name comes from *rhizome* - a philosophical concept from Deleuze & Guattari contrasting hierarchical "tree" structures with distributed networks:

| Tree (Traditional Data) | Rhizome (Rhizo) |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Single root → trunk → branches | Any point connects to any other |
| Top-down hierarchy | No top, no bottom |
| One path to data | Multiple paths to data |
| Central authority | Distributed |
| Siloed tables | Cross-table transactions |

### Why This Fits

- **Content-addressable storage** = no central path, hash is the address
- **Cross-table ACID** = everything connects to everything
- **Git-like branching** = multiple entry points to same data
- **No hierarchy** = tables aren't siloed, they're networked

---

## Why Roots?

- Roots are **foundational** (we're infrastructure)
- Roots are **hidden but essential** (like our deduplication layer)
- Roots **share resources** (like our cross-table transactions)
- Root networks are **massive** (largest organisms on Earth are fungal/root networks)

We're not building another database. We're building the root system that connects all your data.

## Comparisons

When comparing to competitors:

| vs. Delta/Iceberg/Hudi | Rhizo |
|------------------------|-------|
| Single-table transactions | Cross-table ACID |
| Path-based storage | Content-addressable |
| No deduplication | 84% deduplication |
| Limited branching | Zero-copy branching (280 bytes) |

---

## One-Liners

- "Git for data, but with ACID transactions."
- "What if your entire data estate was one connected system?"
- "Cross-table transactions. Zero-copy branching. Time travel. One runtime."
- "The root system for your data infrastructure."
